      "   - Decomposing the problem into multiple thought steps\n",

      "\n",
      "4. Human-in-the-loop decomposition:\n",

Sister states the patient has always been cognitively delayed and diagnosed schizophrenia years ago. She states the patient was living with her other sister for years but she passed away last year. Since then patient has been progressively declining with mentation and depression.

Sex: male MRN: 12321 Admit date: 9/24/2025 Attending: Jayanarayanan CP ,MBBS Date of consult:10/5/2025 CCD: Reason for Consult: Persistent altered mental status Subjective HPI 58 y.o. male is consulted for persistent encephalopathy. Neurology has been consulted for patients encephalopathy not improving even after being in the hospital since 9/24/2025. History was obtained from reviewing the chart. I tried calling his sister to get a little more history and have left a voicemail. Patient has a history of atrial fibrillation (on Eliquis, noncompliant, last dose 3 days ago), cardiomyopathy with an EF of 39% (December 2024, previously 60% in 2021) and grade 2 diastolic dysfunction, CAD by CT calcification, alcohol use disorder, liver cirrhosis, and tobacco use disorder was brought to the ED from his rehab facility (Easter Seals) for unclear reasons. Facility staff reportedly had expressed concern about a possible medical condition. The patient does not routinely see a PCP, is a poor historian, and is frequently nonadherent with medications. His home was described as messy and unsanitary, with evidence of incontinence. He was hospitalized at this facility six months ago for atrial fibrillation, during which cardiology deferred cardioversion due to alcohol withdrawal and recommended outpatient evaluation for possible heart catheterization by Dr. Patel, which the patient likely did not pursue. Social work determined that he did not meet inpatient psychiatric admission criteria. During the initial admission, the patient was unsure why he was transferred from his rehab facility. He denied chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, or hallucinations. He reported his last alcohol use was the prior day (four drinks, though historically up to twelve beers daily) and admitted missing Eliquis for the past three days due to inability to refill. Given his history of alcohol abuse, he was started on the CIWA protocol, continued on home Remeron and Trileptal, and initiated on folic acid 1 mg daily, thiamine 100 mg daily, and a multivitamin. His ethanol level was always less than 10, TSH was within normal limits, and urine drug screen was positive for marijuana. A social work consultation was requested. On 9/26/25, the patient was noted to be withdrawing, encephalopathic, and lethargic, prompting a rapid response and ICU consultation. On 9/27/25, he remained encephalopathic and was transferred to the ICU, where he was started on Precedex. On 9/28/25, he was lethargic but resting. By 9/29/25 and 9/30/25, he had become obtunded. On 10/1/25, he was arousable but remained confused and lethargic. On 10/2/25, he continued to be lethargic and encephalopathic. The patient was screened for food insecurity, housing instability, transportation needs, utility difficulties, and interpersonal safety during this admission. Case management/social work was consulted for further evaluation. Update: 10/04/2025: Patient is more awake, incoherent in his response. Inappropriate laughter present. 10/5/2025 - Patient more responsive. Has slurred speech. Moves all 4 limbs Objective Physical exam Temp -36.4 &deg;C (97.5 &deg;F) BP - (!) 131/97 HR - 92 RR - 16 SpO2 - 98 % NEUROLOGIC: a comprehensive neurologic exam was performed.

There is no evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage. No abnormal gradient susceptibility is present. Mild white matter hyperintensities, likely chronic microvascular ischemic disease. Mild diffuse cerebral atrophy. There is no evidence of an intracranial mass lesion. CT head: There is no hydrocephalus. There is no midline shift or herniation.

He previously worked as an environmental manager(chemical engineer in UofM), monitoring pollution and ventilation in production plants, and retired in 2009. He stated that he had no neurological issues until 2020. During a hospitalization for atrial fibrillation and pulmonary disease, he was also noted to have foot drop, which later resolved. He reported having fine tremors in his hands for years, which began worsening in 2020 and continued to progress. He had been following with Dr. Fadi H. Delly, MD, since then. &nbsp; He described tremors as fine, resting, flexion-extension tremors in both hands. He also endorsed low-amplitude supination-pronation tremors at the elbows, particularly when holding or moving objects. He noted difficulty eating certain foods like soup and peas, although he was able to drink coffee by filling the cup only halfway to avoid spilling. He also reported ongoing balance issues that began in 2020. He experienced two falls\n",
